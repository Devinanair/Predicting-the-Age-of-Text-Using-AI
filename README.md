This data science TextAge project aims to predict the age of historical texts using AI. The project utilized cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, to analyze linguistic patterns and temporal changes in texts from the 1500s to the 1920s. This work contributes to the broader understanding of linguistic evolution.
